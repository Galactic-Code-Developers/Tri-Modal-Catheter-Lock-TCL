**Tri-Modal Antifungal Catheter Lock (TCL): Proof of Invention Record**

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains the public disclosure and LaTeX documentation for the **Tri-Modal Antifungal Catheter Lock (TCL)** —  
a novel, non-systemic antimicrobial lock formulation designed to eradicate *Candidozyma (Candida) auris* and other resistant fungal biofilms from indwelling medical devices.

The formulation integrates **three synergistic components**:
1. **Echinocandin antifungal** (e.g., micafungin)
2. **β-1,3-glucanase enzyme** (for extracellular matrix digestion)
3. **Gallium(III)/EDTA complex** (for iron substitution and metabolic disruption)

Together, these mechanisms collapse the biofilm matrix, inhibit cell-wall synthesis, and block iron metabolism — achieving ≥3-log CFU reduction without damaging catheter materials.
