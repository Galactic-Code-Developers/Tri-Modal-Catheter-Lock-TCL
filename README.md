**Tri-Modal Antifungal Catheter Lock (TCL): Proof of Invention Record**

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains the public disclosure and LaTeX documentation for the **Tri-Modal Antifungal Catheter Lock (TCL)** —  
a novel, non-systemic antimicrobial lock formulation designed to eradicate *Candidozyma (Candida) auris* and other resistant fungal biofilms from indwelling medical devices.

The formulation integrates **three synergistic components**:
1. **Echinocandin antifungal** (e.g., micafungin)
2. **β-1,3-glucanase enzyme** (for extracellular matrix digestion)
3. **Gallium(III)/EDTA complex** (for iron substitution and metabolic disruption)

Together, these mechanisms collapse the biofilm matrix, inhibit cell-wall synthesis, and block iron metabolism — achieving ≥3-log CFU reduction without damaging catheter materials.

## 🔬 Scientific Summary

### Mechanism of Action

| Component                 | Target               | Function                            |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Echinocandin (micafungin) | β-glucan synthase    | Disrupts fungal cell wall synthesis |
| β-1,3-Glucanase           | Extracellular matrix | Liquefies polysaccharide ECM        |
| Ga³⁺ + EDTA               | Metal metabolism     | Iron substitution & chelation       |

This tri-modal mechanism produces a **superlinear reduction** in residual viability:

$$
\Phi_{\mathrm{TCL}} = \eta_{\mathrm{ech}} \cdot \eta_{\mathrm{enz}} \cdot \left( 1 - \frac{[Fe^{3+}]_{\mathrm{biofilm}}}{[Fe^{3+}]_{0}} \right)
$$

Where the combined inhibition terms result in complete matrix collapse and ≥3-log biofilm reduction within 90 minutes.
