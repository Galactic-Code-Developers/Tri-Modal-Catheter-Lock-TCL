abstract: >
  This record discloses the Tri-Modal Antifungal Catheter Lock (TCL),
  a non-systemic antifungal formulation combining three synergistic mechanisms:
  (1) echinocandin antifungal inhibition of β-glucan synthase,
  (2) β-1,3-glucanase enzymatic digestion of extracellular matrix polysaccharides,
  and (3) gallium(III)/EDTA complex-induced iron substitution disrupting
  metabolic integrity of fungal biofilms. Together, these interactions produce
  ≥3-log biofilm reduction within 90 minutes without catheter degradation.
  The proof of invention establishes timestamped prior-art protection
  for open scientific disclosure and non-commercial research collaboration.
