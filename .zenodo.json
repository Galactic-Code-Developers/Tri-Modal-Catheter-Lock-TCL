  "description": "<p>Open scientific disclosure and LaTeX documentation for the <b>Tri-Modal Antifungal Catheter Lock (TCL)</b> — a non-systemic antifungal catheter lock combining three synergistic mechanisms: (1) echinocandin inhibition of β-glucan synthase, (2) β-1,3-glucanase enzymatic digestion of the extracellular matrix, and (3) gallium(III)/EDTA complex-induced iron substitution disrupting fungal metabolic integrity. Together, these mechanisms produce ≥3-log biofilm reduction within 90 minutes without catheter degradation.</p>",
