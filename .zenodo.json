  "description": "<p>This repository provides the open scientific disclosure and LaTeX documentation for the <b>Tri-Modal Antifungal Catheter Lock (TCL)</b> — a novel, non-systemic antifungal catheter lock composition designed to eradicate <i>Candidozyma (Candida) auris</i> and other resistant fungal biofilms. The TCL integrates three synergistic mechanisms: (1) echinocandin antifungal activity, (2) β-1,3-glucanase enzymatic digestion of the extracellular matrix, and (3) gallium(III)/EDTA-mediated iron substitution disrupting metabolic integrity. Together, these effects yield ≥3-log biofilm reduction within 90 minutes without catheter degradation.</p>",
